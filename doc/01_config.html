<strong>Prerequisites</strong>
<br /><br />
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html" target="_blank"><img src="image/Java_Logo_133x68.png"></a>
<br /><br />
GD Stash is a Java application. In order to run it, you need to have a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.
You can download one below
<br /><br />
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html" target="_blank"><img src="image/getjavasoftware-180x150.png"></a>
<br /><br />
If you use a 64 bit Windows, download the 64 bit Java Virtual Machine.<br />
</p>

<br />

<br />

<p class="centered">
<strong>Installation</strong>
<br /><br />
No installation is required, simply extract the zip file to a directory of your choice and double-click the .jar file
to execute it.
<br />
</p>

<br />
<hr size="8" color="DDDDDD">
<br />

<p class="centered">
<strong>Upgrading</strong>
<br /><br />
Place the zip file of the new version in the directory you installed GD Stash in and extract it there, 
<strong>overwriting</strong> the existing files.
<br /><br />
If your unzip tool does not 'like' overwriting files, delete the content of the directory. Your items are
stored in a separate directory in your user-directory (usually C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\GDStash), so your
items are save when doing this.
<br /><br />
If the database format has changed in the new version of GD Stash (or it has additional configuration options),
a popup will be shown when you run the program (see below). When the configuration has changed, review the options
and save it again, even if you keep the default settings. When the database format has changed, simply import
it again (after having updated the configuration, in case both changed).
</p>

<strong>Configuration</strong>
<br /><br />
When starting GD Stash for the first time, it will remind you to configure GD Stash and import the Grim Dawn data.
<br /><br />
<img src="image/Config_Import.png">
<br /><br />

It will take you right to the configuration page, which consists of several parts.<br /><br />
The directories<br /><br />

<table border="3" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td valign="centered" align="left" border="0" cellspacing="0">
      Grim Dawn installation directory
    </td>
    <td class="left" valign="top">
	  The directory Grim Dawn is installed in.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="centered" align="left" border="0" cellspacing="0">
      Grim Dawn save game directory
    </td>
    <td valign="left" align="left" border="0" cellspacing="0">
      The directory Grim Dawn saves its savefiles (the shared stashes, e.g transfer.gst) in.
	  <br /><br />
	  The tool will confirm the directory by checking for the shared stash (file transfer.gst or transfer.gsh).
	  If neither is found it will not accept the directoy. The file is created the first time you talk to the
	  smuggler in Devil's Crossing, so make sure you have done that / the file exists if the tool does not accept
	  your save directory.
	  </br></br>
	  Depending on whether you use Steam cloud saving or not, the location will differ.
	  </br></br>
	  If you are using <strong>local</strong> saves, the files are in 
	  <p class="border">
	  C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\Documents\My Games\Grim Dawn\save</p>
	  If you do use Steam cloud saving (<strong>not recommended</strong>), the files are in 
	  <p class="border">
	  C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\&lt;folder of numbers&gt;\219990\remote\save</p>
	  <warn>If you use Steam Cloud saving, do not edit any files while running Grim Dawn and wait a few seconds
	  between closing GD and editing the files in GD Stash.</warn><br/>
	  Based on feedback I recevied, this seems to avoid most of the potential pitfalls of cloud saving (I do not
	  use cloud saves).
	  <br/><br/>
	  You can always store items in GD Stash while playing Grim Dawn with cloud save enabled, but do not change
	  the Grim Dawn files (stash or char) while playing.
	  <br /><br />

	  <strong>Each mod needs to have its database imported. For each mod a separate database is being created to avoid
	  conflicts between mods.</strong>
	  </br></br>
	  This also means each mod has a separate collection of items. An item stored under one mod can be placed in the shared 
	  stash of a different mod, the tool does not prevent this.</br>
	  If you then however load that stash in that mod and the item is not supported by that mod, Grim Dawn will silently
	  remove it and you lose the item (unless you copied it, rather than transferred it), so be careful when placing items
	  of one mod in the stash of another.
	  </br></br>
	  The same is true for characters you play in a mod, except that the character does not 'belong' to any mod (the shared
	  stash stores the info which mod it is from in the file, a char does not).
