<div id='HeapSize'></div>
<strong>I get a 'Java Heap Space' error. What should I do ?</strong>
<br /><br />

<ol>
  <li>
    Increase the heap size by using the .bat file to start GD Stash. To do so, right-click on the .bat file and choose 'Edit'.
    Make sure the path to java.exe specified in the file matches the directory that java.exe is in on your system.
	<p class="border">
	"<warn>C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.8.0_144\bin\</warn>java.exe" -Xms1152m -Xmx1152m  -jar GDStash.jar</p>
    Make sure to include the parentheses if the path to java.exe contains spaces.
	<br /><br />
	Save the file and then run it by double-clicking on it.
	</br /><br />
  </li>
  <li>
    If you still have the issue, try using a <strong>64 bit</strong> Java Virtual Machine (this requires a 64 bit OS) and
	make sure it is being used.
	</br />
	To do so, edit the path to java.exe in the .bat file, so it contains the directory of the 64bit version, e.g.
	</br />
	<p class="border">
	"C:\<warn>Program Files</warn>\Java\jdk1.8.0_144\bin\java.exe" -Xms1152m -Xmx1152m  -jar GDStash.jar</p>
	instead of 'Program Files (x86)'
	</br /><br />
  </li>
  <li>
    If you still have the problem, make sure you actually have enough free RAM, 1.5 GB should be sufficient.
  </li>
</ol>

<strong>GD Stash says the GD Save Dir is wrong, but I am sure it is the correct one. What can I do ?</strong>
<br /><br />

The tool checks for the existence of a transfer.gst or transfer.gsh file (SC or HC stash). If neither exists,
the dir is not accepted. To create one, talk to the smuggler in Devil's Crossing.
<br />

<div id='SteamCloud'></div>
<strong>Does this tool work with Steam cloud save files ?</strong>
<br /><br />

No, only with local save files.
</br></br>
You can store items from the local files of the cloud saves in GD Stash, but I have not found a reliable way to get them
back into the game (which is not to say that it never works, only that it is not reliable). While GD Stash does always
correctly store them in the local file, Grim Dawn frequently ignores that file and uses the data from the cloud instead,
ignoring the change and overwriting it with the cloud data again.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Do not edit your char files while Grim Dawn is running, especially changing char names, when using cloud save.
I have heard of a char corruption due to this (outside of the player.gdc file that GD Stash modifies) because of this.</strong>
<br /><br />
Renaming a character also changes the directory it is stored in, as char name and dir name have to match. This is most likely
the cause of the corruption.
<br />

<strong>Can I edit the shared stash while I am playing in game ?</strong>
<br /><br />

Yes, provided the shared stash is <strong>not</strong> open in game and you are <strong>not</strong> using Steam cloud save.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<strong>Can I edit a character I am currently playing in game ?</strong>
<br /><br />

No, never change a character that is currently loaded in game.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<strong>How do I back up my items ?</strong>
<br /><br />

The GD Stash database is stored in C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\GDStash. You can either back up that directory (about 100 MB of
which ia Grim Dawn data) or use the Im-/Export page to store only the collected items in a file (without the Grim Dawn data).
<br /><br />

By pressing

<br /><br />
<img src="image/MassImport_Export.png">
<br /><br />
 
the items get exported to a file. <strong>Note that only items of the current database are exported. If you play different
mods you need to export the items of each mod seperately.</strong>
<br /><br />

You can import the file again by pressing

<br /><br />
<img src="image/MassImport_LoadDB.png">
<br /><br />

This only loads the items into an overview table, the actual import to the GD Stash database is done by
selecting the items to import and pressing
 
<br /><br />

<br />

<br />

<strong>After importing the DB, I get a list of messages. What should I do ?</strong>
<br /><br />

Unless that list contains error messages, ignore it. The below are typical messages everyone importing
the GD data will get, as they are due to the data.

<br /><br />
<img src="image/Config_DBImport.png">
<br /><br />
 
The warning messages are inconsistencies in Grim Dawn's data but of no consequence (only for items that do not drop).
<br /><br />

If you use a localization zip and get a lot of 'missing tag' warnings, please check if the localization file is
for the current Grim Dawn version and use a newer one if necessary / available.
<br /><br />

If you use a mod, the warnings you are getting are similarily due to the mod data.

<strong>While editing my shared stash, it got corrupted. What can I do ?</strong>
<br /><br />

The tool always creates a backup of the previous stash first. transfer.t00 for SC, transfer.h00 for HC.
By renaming that file back to .gst / .gsh you can recover it.<br /><br />
The tool also keeps older versions with ascending numbers (.t00, .t01, .t02, ...) so if you did multiple edits
before you noticed the corruption, try the older files.

<strong>You added support for Spears and Staffs from the Grim Quest mod. My mod also has new item types, will you add them ?</strong>
<br /><br />

The short answer is no.
<br /><br />
 
I added the Grim Quest items because Grim Dawn is the spiritual successor to Titan Quest.
Being its spiritual successor, Grim Dawn actually still had some unused tags for these item types, which I am now using
to support them.</br>
No other item type has such unused tags, so no other item type has this kind of support within Grim Dawn itself, so it
cannot be supported like that in GD Stash either.
